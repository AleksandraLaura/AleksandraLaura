### Hi there ✨

- 🏔 I’m currently working on palaeodietary reconstruction from birch tar from Neolithic lake sediments in and around the Alps
- 📚 I’m looking for help with listing a bunch of taxonomic profilers (the whole bunch actually - I want to catch them all 🐹) - to create a better overview and consensus for everyone working on metagenomic data
- 💬 Ask me about ANYTHING (always eager to help and learn new stuff)
- 📫 How to reach me: aleksandra.pach@sund.ku.dk
- ⚡ Fun fact: I surf 🏄 and my puppy's name is Meeka 🦝
